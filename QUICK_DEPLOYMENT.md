# Quick Deployment Guide - Bible Reflection App

## üöÄ **FASTEST DEPLOYMENT OPTION**

### **Web Deployment (Recommended Start)**

Since the full web build has SQLite compatibility issues, here are the quickest deployment options:

#### Option 1: Deploy Mobile-First with Expo Go
```bash
# 1. Start the development server
npm start

# 2. Share the app instantly via QR code
# Users can scan the QR code with Expo Go app
# Works on both iOS and Android immediately
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No build process needed
- ‚úÖ Works immediately on all devices
- ‚úÖ All features work (SQLite, AI recommendations)
- ‚úÖ Perfect for testing and sharing with users

#### Option 2: Create Simple Web Preview
```bash
# 1. Run the development server on web
npm run web

# 2. Use ngrok to expose it publicly
npx ngrok http 3000
```

## üåê **WEB DEPLOYMENT ALTERNATIVES**

### Option A: PWA (Progressive Web App)

Create a simple PWA version:

1. **Create web-compatible version:**
```bash
# Remove SQLite dependency for web
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

2. **Deploy to Netlify/Vercel:**
- Build the React Native Web version without SQLite
- Use localStorage for web data persistence
- Deploy static files

### Option B: Expo Web (Future)

Wait for Expo to fix SQLite web compatibility, or:
- Remove SQLite plugin from web builds
- Use IndexedDB directly for web version
- Build with different configurations per platform
