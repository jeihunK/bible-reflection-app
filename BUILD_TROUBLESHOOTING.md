# Build Failed - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 **Issue: "Unknown error. See logs of the Prepare project build phase"**

This is a common issue with Expo's free tier builds. Here are proven solutions:

---

## 🚀 **Solution 1: Check Build Logs**

First, let's see what the actual error is:

```bash
# View detailed build logs
eas build:list

# Get the build ID from the list, then:
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]
```

This will show you the specific error that caused the failure.

---

## 🚀 **Solution 2: Fix Common Issues**

### **Update app.json with more details:**

Add these fields to fix common build issues:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Bible Reflection",
    "slug": "bible-reflection-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.biblereflection.app",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "compileSdkVersion": 34,
      "targetSdkVersion": 34,
      "permissions": []
    }
  }
}
```

### **Update eas.json for better compatibility:**

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 0.52.0",
    "appVersionSource": "local"
  },
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 **Solution 3: Clean Build**

Try a completely clean build:

```bash
# Clear all caches
eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache --no-wait

# Or with specific npm cache clear
npm cache clean --force
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

---

## 🚀 **Solution 4: Simplify Dependencies**

The issue might be with expo-sqlite on the build servers. Let's create a minimal build:

### **Create a temporary eas.json without problematic plugins:**

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 0.52.0",
    "appVersionSource": "local"
  },
  "build": {
    "preview-minimal": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      },
      "env": {
        "EXPO_NO_CAPABILITY_SYNC": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then build with:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview-minimal
```

---

## 🚀 **Solution 5: Local Development Build (Recommended)**

Since EAS Build is having issues, let's create a local development build:

### **Method A: Expo Development Build**

```bash
# Install required tools
npm install -g @expo/cli
npx expo install expo-dev-client

# Run local Android build
npx expo run:android
```

### **Method B: Create APK with Android Studio**

1. **Export for Android Studio:**
   ```bash
   npx expo eject
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio and build APK**
